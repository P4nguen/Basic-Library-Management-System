# Very-Basic-Library-Management-System
Project Start: A basic library system where you can use the system via terminalIt is very basic and once you turn it off all the information and data you added or removed just dissappears. So i am still working on an advanced one.

I finally made a version of my library system where my system is not basic anymore. Now you can add and remove users which was quite challenging for me, also you can see which user borrowed which book. I am now working on making this work with actual time (To measure how many days a user had that book) and of course most importantly a saving system which saves all the data of the users and books, so wish me luck!

Future Goals: GUI for the system
